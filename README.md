# Linear-ragression-in-python
Here I try to provide the python version of week 2 assignment in introduction to machine learning on Coursera by Andrew Ng; as I see many people try to follow up with this course but with python instead of Matlab of octave for several reseans, most importantly, they want to increase their skills in numpy and matplot, and python is more popular.

I tried to use the same variable names by original file provided by Andrew, same sections,same function names, and I even copied all comments; as not to get confused.

Libs used:
Numpy 
Matplotlib
